    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous posts analyzing the <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> dataset I have looked at
<a href="http://isurfsoftware.com/blog/2012/12/13/visualizing-geographic-connections-between-us-doctors/">the geographic connections between referrals</a> and
<a href="http://isurfsoftware.com/blog/2013/01/27/analyzing-out-of-state-patient-referrals-using-docgraph/">out of state referrals</a>. In this post I decided to change
directions from geographic analysis and instead focus on the different types of providers involved in patient referrals. In particular I wanted to take a crack at answering the question:
"what type of doctor will you see next?"</p>

<p>As always the first step to answering this question was to enrich the <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> data with data from the NPI database. In particular we need the taxonomy code for each of the nodes in the <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> dataset.
After the we have added taxonomy code to all the nodes we then want to aggregate all referrals by taxonomy code to shrink the size of our dataset down into something that is more easily managed on a single machine.
In order to achieve this goal with short iteration time I used <a href="http://bit.ly/10RKWmf">Amazon EMR</a> and <a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Apache Hive</a>. The distributed nature of <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> enabled me to join the large
NPI database with the even larger <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> dataset and perform the necessary aggregation all in under 20 minutes with a cost of only $1.04. You can find the Hive script I used to perform the join and aggregation on <a href="http://bit.ly/16Br1Qo">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Once the Docgraph dataset had been aggregated by taxonomy code it was a simple matter of converting the taxonomy code to the human readable provider type. This was achieved using the <a href="http://www.nucc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=125">Health Care Provider Taxonomy dataset</a>
and some R code that you can find on <a href="http://bit.ly/11O4FrY">Github</a>. A little bit more aggregation to account for the multiple levels of taxonomy codes, including specialization, and the data needed to answer our question was ready. I also removed any referrals where both nodes were of the same provider
type as these are most likely noise in the dataset caused by the billing method through which the <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> data was collected.</p>

<p>Below is a table showing the top 20 referrals between provider types. Not surprisingly we can see that the vast majority of patients are being referred for to Radiology
for various types of test such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. They are then referred back to an <em>Internal Medicine</em> doctor which I hypothesize is the physician acting as primary care.
Another interesting, but not all that surprising, relationship is the number of referrals between <em>Emergency Medicine</em> and <em>Internal Medicine</em>. Here I hypothesize that patients are being
seen for some emergency medical condition and then receive follow-up care from their primary care provider.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting observation from this top 20 list is the number of times <em>Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Disease</em> appears. I always knew that America had a problem with heart disease but I was still a bit surprised at the volume of this type of referral. I would love to hear if anyone else has a hypothesis for why there are so many referrals
related to <em>Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Disease</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, I can't resist a sexy visualization that helps to convey the elegance of the <a href="http://docgraph.org/?page_id=4">DocGraph</a> dataset. Below you will find a visualization of the
referrals between provider types. The thickness of the edge reflects the number of patients that are referred between the two provider types. To create the visualization I used the open source <a href="http://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> graph visualization platform.</p>

    <id>http://rweald.github.com/blog/2013/01/27/analyzing-out-of-state-patient-referrals-using-docgraph</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I previously built a <a href="http://isurfsoftware.com/blog/2012/12/13/visualizing-geographic-connections-between-us-doctors/">visualization of the U.S. medical graph</a> using the
<a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html">DocGraph</a> dataset.
The visualization prompted me to ask the question, does the state where you live affect the likelihood you will be referred to a doctor in another state?</p>

<p>Using the full <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html">DocGraph</a> dataset I was able to answer this question; in short North Carolina had the highest percentage of patients referred out-of-state with ~ 28% of referrals going out of state. Michigan and California had the lowest percent with only ~10% of referrals going out of state.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this post I shall describe the process I used to obtain these result and provide a more detailed look at the impact state has on probability of inter-state referrals.</p>

<p>The first step in the analysis was joining the DocGraph referral graph with the
<a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/index.html">National Provider Identifier database</a>.
By joining DocGraph with the NPI database I was able to determine the state of the referring physician as well as the state of the physician the patient was being referred to. After augmenting the DocGraph with this additional information it was simply a matter of aggregating referrals grouped by state. Once aggregated I had a state to state adjacency matrix which could be further aggregated to generate the graphs shows below.</p>

<p>For details on reproducing this analysis and all the code used <a href="https://github.com/rweald/docgraph-data-analysis/tree/master/state-level-graph-analysis">visit Github</a>. There are also some limitations to this analysis that are described in the footnotes <a href="#limitations">1</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth map</a> representing the percent of patients that were referred outside of the state. As you can see North Carolina, Pennsylvania have the highest percent out-of-state referrals. There is also an area of increased out-of-state referrals in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Census_Regions_and_Division_of_the_United_States.svg">mountain region</a>.</p>

</a></p>

<p>A complement to the above image is shown below; The color represents the percent of patients that are referred within the same state. As you would expect the larger states such as California, Texas, and New York have the highest percentage of patients referred within the same state.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/X4RRH9">
  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rweald-docgraph-analysis/percent-in-state-choropleth-dev.png" alt="percent-in-state-referrals" height=450 width=800 />
</a></p>

<p>For those readers who want more detail on the statistical distributions of state level referrals you can find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimate</a> plots in the footnotes <a href="#distributions">2</a>.</p>

<p>After analyzing the probability of inter-referrals I got curious where all these out-of-state referrals were going. As a first step towards understanding out-of-state referrals I assembled a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heat map</a>. This heat map provides some details on which states patients are being referred to. Each square in the heat map represents an entry in the state to state adjacency matrix contained in the DocGraph network.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/W9mpdx">
  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rweald-docgraph-analysis/inter-state-referrals-heatmap.png" alt="inter-state-referral-heatmap" height=450 width=800 />
</a></p>

<p>The results above should have provide a good answer to the question of the impact of state on likelihood of out-of-state referrals. In addition we can get an idea of which states have the most inter-state referral traffic. Overall I think this analysis brings us one step closer to unlocking the potential of the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html">DocGraph</a> data to help us understand the U.S. health graph <a href="#limitations">1</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed my analysis.

  <span style="font-style: bold:"> 1.</span>
  <p id="limitations">
  There are a couple of important limitations of the data to remember when interpreting this analysis. The DocGraph data set only includes data from 2011; we can assume that physician behavior is much the same today as it was in 2011, however without a sample from some other time period we can not be sure. Secondly, DocGraph only represents Medicare referrals which may not be representative of the entire healthcare system. Unfortunately a more comprehensive dataset including private referrals is not available to me at this time. Therefore, the DocGraph dataset is the best referral sample I could get as a private citizen.

    <link href="http://rweald.github.com/blog/2012/12/13/visualizing-geographic-connections-between-us-doctors/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-13T08:05:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rweald.github.com/blog/2012/12/13/visualizing-geographic-connections-between-us-doctors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently acquired access to the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html">DocGraph</a> data set on
<a href="http://www.medstartr.com/projects/93-phase-ii-next-level-doctor-social-graph">MedStartr</a>.
This data set contains a social network of U.S. doctors, with each connection representing
a physician referring a patient to another physician.
Given this new unique data I thought it would be interesting to investigate the geographic connections between doctors. What better way to start
analyzing the data than to make a sexy visualization.</p>

<p>To create the final visualization I had to combine multiple data sets to enrich the doctor social graph with geographic coordinates.
I began by taking a sample of 1 million connections from
<a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html">DocGraph</a> and joining it with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Provider_Identifier">National Provider Identifier</a> (NPI) database.
By joining these two data sets I was able to get the zip code of each physicians practice. The final step was converting the zip codes to
latitude-longitude coordinates using
a <a href="http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/">publicly available zip code database</a>. Now that the data was in the correct format I began work on the visualization.</p>

<p>The visualization I choose was heavily inspired by the great
work of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/visualizing-friendships/469716398919">Paul Butler at Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Using a similar method to the one documented in <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/">Nathan Yau's tutorial</a> I graphed the
connections between physicians using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circles</a>. In order to see the cluster density I layered the connections
using Euclidean distance, with the longest paths being drawn first.
All of the code used to generate this visualization is open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rweald/docgraph-data-analysis/tree/master/visualize-geographic-connections">Github</a></p>

<p>Below is the resulting visualization. Note the areas of high and low density as you move from the east coast over to the west coast.
There are also some interesting connections from
Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the Continental United States.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rweald-docgraph-analysis/map-of-connections-fullsize.png">

</a></p>

<p>You can download the full sized graphic <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rweald-docgraph-analysis/map-of-connections-with-text-fullsize.png">here</a>.
<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">
  I recommend you right-click and "save link as" because the file is approximately 40MB.
</span></p>

<p>This visualization is only the beginning. The added feature of geography opens the door to many interesting analyses.
