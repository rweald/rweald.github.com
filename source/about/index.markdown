I am a data scientist at
[Sharethrough](http://sharethrough.com) where I use data to rid the internet of disruptive advertising. 
I studied Computer Science and Bioinformatics at UCSD before dropping out to try and make my mark on the world. 
In my spare time I contribute to open source, hack on healthcare, and dodge sharks while surfing in Northern California.
