I'm currently pursing my entrepreneurial interests building data products to help people understand their bodies and eliminate chronic disease before it begins.
I'm passionate about machine learning, programming languages, software engineering, startups, and using data to improve peoples lives.
In my spare time I: climb indoor rocks, play tennis, hack on open healthcare data, and dodge sharks while surfing in Northern California.
